# Cat Antagonizing Tactical Platform of Oppression (CATPOO)

This project utilizes a Rasperberry Pi for everything except sensor inputs.
For all inputs and blinken lights, an Arduino Nano is used.

# Required Parts

* Chassis
    * Currently, I'm using the schematics from `docs/circle chassis/`.
    * The actual chassis and stuff isn't really that important to this code,
      so it won't be documented well until I'm settled on a final design.
* Parts
    * [Arduino Nano|https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardNano]
    * [Raspberry Pi 2|https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/]
        * Not technically necessary, but having a Pi 2 is nicer. Any Pi will do
          if you got a different one laying around.
    * [Pi NoIR camera|https://www.adafruit.com/products/1567]
        * Cuz what's the point of a robot that can't see in the dark? How else
          can one scare away one's girlfriend effectively?
    * [IR Leds|https://www.adafruit.com/products/388]
        * The more, the merrier
    * Breadboards (just got a bunch)
    * [Maestro server controller|https://www.pololu.com/product/1350]
    * [2x Servos|https://www.pololu.com/product/1248]
    * [Track links|https://www.pololu.com/product/415]
    * [Sprockets|https://www.pololu.com/product/224]

There are other miscellaneous things you'll need like extra wires, extra LEDs
for whatever, and so on. This will be documented More Betterâ„¢ later on.

Or maybe not.
