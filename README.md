# Cat Antagonizing Tactical Platform of Oppression (CATPOO)

This project is for my autodidactic hacking pleasure. One of my childhood
dreams was to create a robot like a T-800. One day...

In the meantime, figured it wouldn't be too hard to create a robot that
can antagonize and annoy cats or small dogs.
